# Week 2 team social event

Team Name

Ryan Enshaie, Adam Yee, Damon Wong, Byung Kim, Antonio Montalvo

Our first social event was getting food at Phoenix Food Court.  We just finished the first sponsor meeting, so we were
all already together.  We talked about our interests, career desires, and what we like to do in our free time.  We also
talked about whether anyone was going anywhere over the summer, and what other project choices we considered.  Even though
it was a simple social event, we were all able to bond with each other well.
