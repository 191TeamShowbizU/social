# Week 5 team social event

The Showmen

Damon Wong, Adam Yee, Antonio Montalvo, Ryan Enshaie, Byung Kim

For our social event, we decided to pay cards for a while when all of us were free. We played games like poker, blackjack, and 21. It was funny because some of us often got dealt bad hands and kept losing. While we were playing we also discussed how we were going to deal with the slower pace set by our sponsor. But we understood that our sponsor wanted us to learn the importance of planning.
